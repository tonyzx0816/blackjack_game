Blackjack

This Python program simulates a simplified game of Blackjack against the computer.
***********************************************
How to Play:

1. Start the game: The game begins by dealing two cards to you and the computer.

2. Make your choice:
      Type 'y': Draw another card to your hand.
      Type 'n': Stand pat with your current hand.

3. Computer's turn: The computer will continue to draw cards until its score reaches 17 or higher.

4. Determine the winner: The program compares your score to the computer's score and declares the winner based on the following rules:

      Blackjack: If either player has an initial hand of 21 (Ace and 10-value card), they win immediately.

      Bust: If either player's score exceeds 21, they lose.

      Higher score wins: If neither player busts, the player with the higher score wins.

      Draw: If both players have the same score, it's a draw.

5. Play again: Choose "y" to play another round or "n" to exit the game.
